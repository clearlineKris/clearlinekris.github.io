# ClearLine Compliance — Cannabis Regulatory Consulting

ClearLine Compliance delivers pragmatic, expert-led regulatory compliance services for cannabis operators. We transform complex rules into durable systems, documentation, and processes that reduce risk and keep operations audit-ready.

Tagline: Compliance without the chaos.

## About

Led by Kris — a practitioner with 8+ years in Colorado’s cannabis industry — ClearLine blends frontline operational experience with regulatory documentation expertise and practical automation. Kris has worked directly in cultivation and retail operations, built compliance documentation programs, and produced state-by-state regulatory analysis to help operators enter and scale in new markets.

## Core Expertise

- Regulatory strategy & audit preparedness — design and implementation of compliance programs, pre-audit mock inspections, and gap analyses that anticipate enforcement priorities.
- Packaging & labeling compliance — state-aware labeling reviews, claim-risk analysis, and label-review workflows to prevent costly violations.
- Inventory reconciliation & METRC alignment — proven reconciliation workflows, evidence packaging, and remediation that shorten investigations and reduce discrepancy rates.
- Compliance documentation & SOPs — clear, repeatable standard operating procedures, incident logs, and documentation packages that satisfy auditors and regulators.
- Practical automation & tooling — lightweight automations and integrations (Python/JavaScript) that reduce manual burden and produce auditable records.

## Services

- Regulatory audit insight discussions — focused, actionable conversations to interpret audit findings and prioritize remediation.
- Guides on packaging and inventory auditing best practices — pragmatic, state-specific checklists and workflows for labeling and seed-to-sale reconciliation.
- Remediation briefs and checklists — concise plans that translate findings into prioritized fixes with measurable acceptance criteria.
- Consulting retainers for ongoing compliance operations support — embedded or remote support to maintain documentation discipline and audit readiness.

## Approach

ClearLine uses a three-layer approach:
1. The Letter of the Law — authoritative review of statutes and administrative rules.
2. The Penumbra — enforcement patterns, local practice, and unwritten expectations that determine real-world outcomes.
3. Operational Systems — processes, logs, and automation that ensure compliance is repeatable and defensible.

We emphasize clarity, measurable outcomes, and documentation designed to stand up under regulatory review.

## Selected Outcomes

- Built documentation and reconciliation processes for cultivation and retail operations resulting in sustained audit-readiness.
- Delivered labeling and claims guidance that reduced regulatory flags during state inspections.
- Implemented reconciliation workflows that shortened inventory investigation times and reduced discrepancy rates.
