      I have a repo that I am using as an online portfolio featuring my resume,
      as well as blurbs regarding my real-life job experience...something like a
      blog/resume of sorts. How can I maximize my ROI on this repo - my ROI
      being finding a job and finding clients for my nascent consulting
      business? I have 8 years of experience in CO's weed industry, and I am
      currently propping up ClearLine, a unique consuting outfit navigating the
      penumbra of cannabis law & policy nationwide.
